# Android_Sprint6Challenge_Contacts

### Instructions

**Please read this entire README to make sure you understand what is expected of you before you begin.**

This sprint challenge is designed to ensure that you are competent with the concepts taught throughout Sprint 7, Intermediate Java.

Begin by forking this repository. Clone your forked repository to your machine. Commit as appropriate while you work. Push your final project to GitHub, then create a pull request back to this original repository.

**You will have 3 hours to complete this sprint challenge**

If you have any questions about the project requirements or expectations, ask your PM or instructor. Good luck!

### Screen Recording

Please view the screen recordings so you will know what your finished project should look like:

## Requirements

The goal of this challenge is to build a simple "contact manager" app driven by the [randomuser.me API](https://randomuser.me). The randomuser.me API provides lists of random, fake people on demand. See the [documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto) for full information. In short, do a GET request to [https://randomuser.me/api/?format=json&inc=name,email,phone,picture&results=1000](https://randomuser.me/api/?format=json&inc=name,email,phone,picture&results=1000) to get JSON with results back. You can change the `results` URL query parameter to control the number of users you get back (max is 5000).

The requirements for this project are as follows:

1. Your main view controller should display a table view with loaded users.
2. Each table view cell must display the user's (thumbnail) image and their name.
3. The app must fetch and display at least 1000 users. You may include more if desired. You can also add a button to continue loading more users if you'd like (not required).
4. Tapping a user should display a detail view with their full-size image and details including name, phone number, and email address.
5. Your app must fetch images on-demand as the corresponding row is scrolled on screen.
6. It must cancel no-longer-needed fetches as rows scroll off screen.
> Use an `AtomicBoolean` object to communicate the cancellation state. Pass it into the network image method and check periodically if it has been set to true
> Override the onViewDetachedFromWindow method to flag a download as canceled using the `AtomicBoolean`.

7. Scrolling must be smooth and responsive regardless of the number of loaded users.
8. You must implement a generic `Cache` to cache already-fetched thumbnail and fullsize images. `Cache` **must** be thread-safe.
> This could be done with a class that stores the most recently viewed contact images in memory. Be sure to store both the image thumbnail and the larger image, use the last portion of the url as a key to access the storage.
